This was one of my first programs ever made. I made it at the age of probably 14 or 15. The code has bugs and is not perfect but I leave this as an archive as I'm proud of my first little game!

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, written purely in Python

## How To Run and Play
To run simply clone the code, and run tic.py. 
Because Tic is currently in a non gui state, all moves must be manually typed in.
All moves are entered through coordinates. The top row is row 0, middle row is 1 and so on. The same goes for horizontal rows.
The left row is 0, and middle row is 1. So to move a piece onto the center of the board, you would put in the coordinate 1:1.
To enter the coordinate first type the first number, which is one, and then the second, which is also one. 
The picture below shows an example.

Player one is represented by a 1, and player two by a 2. The zeros just represent empty spots on the board
